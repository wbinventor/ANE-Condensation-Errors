first paragraph:
-this will come from chapter 5 of my thesis

\section{Eigenvalue Bias}
\label{sec:bias-eigenvalues}

first paragraph: what are we comparing??
-reference eigenvalues from MC simulations
-reference MC simulation used to collapse MGXS
-multi-group MOC use MGXS to calculate an eigenvalue
-MG eigenvalue is compared to MC eigenvalue with Eqn.~\ref{eqn:delta-rho}

second paragraph: presented tabulated results
-Tab.~\ref{tab:keff-reference} - reference eigenvalues from OpenMC
  -difference between aniso and iso-in-lab: 65 pcm
-Tab.~\ref{tab:keff-bias-aniso} - OpenMC eigenvalues w/ MGXS generated from anisotropic OpenMC simulations
-Tab.~\ref{tab:keff-bias-iso-in-lab} - OpenMOC eigenvalues w/ MGXS generated from iso-in-lab OpenMC simulations

third paragraph: analyze results
-bias grows more negative with more energy groups
  -goes against intuition: eigenvalues should be more accurate w/ more groups
  -with enough groups (e.g., ultra-fine), MG and MC eigenvalues should match exactly
  -but with coarser group structures, the eigenvalues do not match
    -even with ``perfect'' group condensation with the ``true'' flux

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:delta-rho}
\Delta\rho = \left(k_{eff}^{OpenMOC} - k_{eff}^{OpenMC}\right) \times 10^{5}
\end{equation}

-data is for 2D fuel pin with MGXS tallied by FSR

\section{Multi-Group Flux Bias}
\label{sec:bias-flux}

first paragraph: present figures
-Fig.~\ref{fig:rel-err-energy} compares MG and MC flux by energy group
  -innermost and outermost rings of the fuel pin, and average across all rings
-Fig.~\ref{fig:rel-err-space} compares MG and MC flux by spatial zone
  -for three energy group ``ranges'' across all radial rings in the fuel pin
-describe the three energy ranges
  -range A: group for the U-238 capture resonance at 6.67 eV
  -range B: groups spanning the three lowest-lying U-238 capture resonances
  -range C: all U-238 resonance energy groups
  
second paragraph: analyze figures
-take analysis from my thesis
-the errors are largest for range A which most tightly encompasses a single resonance
-errors vary widely across fuel pin
-tie this into an argument of why this:
  (1) causes an eigenvalue bias
  (2) results from loss of angular information with scalar flux-weighted MGXS
-segue into next section on possible solutions
